# Command Line Tools

The command prompt is what we use to enter specific commands for some of our tools, such as when we use Git for version control. While point-and-click programs work for many daily uses, when it comes to programming eventually you will need to use the command line to take advantage of the most powerful tools your computer has to offer, so we teach you to get comfortable with it right from the beginning.

In **Windows**, you already have a command prompt installed. You can find it by going to Start--&gt;Programs and looking for “Command Prompt”. You can also find it through Windows explorer. The **Windows** command prompt does not offer much flexibility and functionality, however. Instead, we will use Git Bash, which was part of your Git Installation above.

If you are a **Mac** user, you can use iTerm2 + oh-my-zsh

* Download and install iTerm2 from the following link: [https://www.iterm2.com/](https://www.iterm2.com/)

* * When prompted for a password enter the password that you use to login to your computer. It may look like you’re not typing anything in but this is because it doesn’t want to display your password on the screen for security. Just type your full password and press enter.

* * When the process is complete your screen should look similar to the following \(note the display in ascii art that oh my zsh ….is now installed and you have a nice colorful arrow prompt\):

Oh-my-zsh helps identify certain things with different colors. Here are some of the colors you might run across.

* Your arrow indicating your prompt will be green.

* The name of the directory \(aka folder\) you’re currently in will be displayed in aqua \(The above picture I’m in my home directory \(/users/myusername\) indicated by the ~ - a shortcut that references the home directory\).

* If you’re in a git repository your branch name will be displayed in a salmon color.

* If you have changes made in the repository that you’re in that haven’t been committed yet you’ll see a yellow x symbol at the end of your prompt ine.
