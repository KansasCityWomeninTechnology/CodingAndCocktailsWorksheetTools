# Install Git

Git is version control software. It helps us keep track of different versions of our code and lets us collaborate with other developers on a project.

* Download Git:\([https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\). Click on the icon that represents **your operating system**.

This takes you to a new page and should automatically start downloading the newest version of the software. Although they offer 32-bit and 64-bit options, you should be able to take the one they suggest as a default.

* Navigate to your Downloads folder and find the Git download. Click to open it and allow it to make changes to your computer. Next, it will guide you through several screens. For the most part, you can accept the suggested selections.

You may wish to select the option to add an icon to your desktop to make it easier to find and open the app later. Once you click through the configuration options, click _**Finish**_** **to complete the installation..

* Optional \(Windows only\): now that Git is installed, you could add it to your start menu and taskbar to make it easier to find.

  * Navigate to where the program was installed. Check here first: _C:\Program Files \(x86\)\Git_

  * Open the Git folder and **right-click on the Git Bash Icon**, and look for an option to “pin to Start” and “pin to taskbar”. These will make it easy to get to when you want to use it.



* The last step is to configure Git so that you can use it with GitHub later.

  * Windows users, open Git Bash. \(Mac users, you’ll want to do this in iTerm2 AFTER you install it in the next section\) . The dollar sign is your prompt. First, you set your user name with the command git config --global user.name "Your Name" \(replacing Your Name with your own name, but leaving the quotation marks around it\)

  * Second, use command git config --global user.email youremail@example.com \(replacing the sample with your actual email\) to set your email address in Git.
