# Node & npm

Node is a JavaScript runtime - this means where JavaScript used to be confined to a web browser you can now run JavaScript on your computer.

npm is a package manager for JavaScript packages.  This allows you to manage and use code from other developers so you don't have to reinvent the wheel and can reuse handy bits of code for common functionality.
