# RUBY \(Windows Users Only\)

> Mac users can skip this section because Ruby already comes installed on your operating system.

To use Sass, Windows users need to install the Ruby programming language. Ruby allows us to use SASS as a CSS compiler for our web pages.

* Go to the Ruby site to download it: [rubyinstaller.org](http://rubyinstaller.org/) . The big red **Download** button will redirect you to a page of options.

* The page provides some direction about which version to choose, but we recommend [**Ruby 2.2.4 \(x64\)**](http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/rubyinstaller-2.2.4-x64.exe). Clicking this option will download Ruby to your downloads folder. As with other downloads, click on the \*.exe file and allow the program to make changes to your computer.

* Select the language, accept the license, and take note of where it suggests that you load the application - probably here: `C:\Ruby22-x64`.
