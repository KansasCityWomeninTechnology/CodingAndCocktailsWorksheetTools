# Organization: Create a Folder For Coding & Cocktails Work

This section will help guide you through the steps listed below. You can check 
{% include "./navigation.html" %}

## Create a folder {#create-dir}
Create a folder in your home directory called "CodingAndCocktails". Weâ€™ll create folders here for our different projects throughout the year.
{% hint style='info' %}
We use the terms **"Folder"** and **"Directory"** interchangeably.  They mean the same thing.

Your home directory is typically `/users/yourname` on a Mac or `C:/Users/yourname` on a Windows machine.

We're using the home directory because terminal applications usually open to home by default. 
{% endhint %}

If you want to challenge yourself try creating the directory via the command line instead of through your file explorer!

1. Open your command line tool (**Cmder** for Windows, **iTerm2** for Macs)
2. Navigate to your home directory. In iTerm2 you can use `cd ~`. In Cmder you can use `cd %USERPROFILE%`. In Cmder, your home directory should be the default starting location.

    {% hint style='tip' %}
`cd` stands for change directory

`~` or `%USERPROFILE%` is a shortcut for your home directory.
    {% endhint %}

3. Create your CodingAndCocktails directory by running the command `mkdir CodingAndCocktails`.

    {% hint style='tip' %}
`mkdir` stands for make directory

Then you provide the name of the directory that you want to create
    {% endhint %}

4. If you want to move into that directory use the `cd` command to get there: `cd CodingAndCocktails`.  

   
   You should have used the following commands
   {% filename %}command{% endfilename %}
   ```bash
   cd ~
   mkdir CodingAndCocktails
   cd CodingAndCocktails
   ```

{% hint style='info' %}
Most command line terminals (including the ones we use) are not case sensitive - but some are! For our purposes, a folder named CodingAndCocktails is the same as one named codingandcocktails.
{% endhint %}
