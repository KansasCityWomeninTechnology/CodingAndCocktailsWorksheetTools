# Organization: Create a Folder For Coding & Cocktails Work

> We use the terms `Folder` and `Directory` interchangably.  They mean the same thing

>Your home directory is typically `/users/yourname` on macs or `C:/Users/yourname` on windows machine

Create a folder in your home directory called `CodingAndCocktails` Weâ€™ll create folders here for our different projects throughout the year. 

If you want to challenge yourself try creating the directory via the command line instead of through your file explorer!

1. Open your command line tool (On windows machines: **Git Bash**, on macs: **iTerm2**)
2. Navigate to your home directory by running the command `cd ~`

    `cd` stands for change directory

    `~` is a shortcut for your home directory
    
3. Create your CodingAndCocktails directory by running the command `mkdir CodingAndCocktails`

    `mkdir` stands for make directory
    
    Then you provide the name of the directory that you want to create
    
4. If you want to move into that directory use the `cd` command to get there: `cd CodingAndCocktails`
    
    

>Note: most command line terminals \(including the ones we use\) are not case sensitive - but a few are! For our purposes, a folder named CodingAndCocktails is the same as one named codingandcocktails.
