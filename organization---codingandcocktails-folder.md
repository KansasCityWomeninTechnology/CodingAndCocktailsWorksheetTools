# Create a Folder For Coding & Cocktails Work

> We use the terms `Folder` and `Directory` interchangably.  They mean the same thing

>Your home directory is typically `/users/yourname` on macs or `C:/Users/yourname` on windows machine

Create a folder in your home directory called `CodingAndCocktails` Weâ€™ll create folders here for our different projects throughout the year. 

>Note: most command line terminals \(including the ones we use\) are not case sensitive - but a few are! For our purposes, a folder named CodingAndCocktails is the same as one named codingandcocktails.
