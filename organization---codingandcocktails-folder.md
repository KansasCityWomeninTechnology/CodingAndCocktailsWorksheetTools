# Create a Folder For Coding & Cocktails Work

Create a folder in your home directory \(this is typically /users/yourname on macs or C:/Users/yourname on windows machine\) called CodingAndCocktails - weâ€™ll create folders here for our different projects. _Note: most command line terminals \(including the ones we use\) are not case sensitive - but a few are!_ For our purposes, a folder named CodingAndCocktails is the same as one named codingandcocktails.
