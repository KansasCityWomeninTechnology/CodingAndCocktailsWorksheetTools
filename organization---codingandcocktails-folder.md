# Organization: Create a Folder For Coding & Cocktails Work

{% hint style='info' %}
We use the terms `Folder` and `Directory` interchangably.  They mean the same thing

Your home directory is typically `/users/yourname` on a mac or `C:/Users/yourname` on a windows machine
{% endhint %}

Create a folder in your home directory called `CodingAndCocktails` Weâ€™ll create folders here for our different projects throughout the year. 

If you want to challenge yourself try creating the directory via the command line instead of through your file explorer!

1. Open your command line tool (**Git Bash** for windows, **iTerm2** for macs)
2. Navigate to your home directory by running the command `cd ~`

    {% hint style='tip' %}
`cd` stands for change directory

`~` is a shortcut for your home directory
    {% endhint %}
    
3. Create your CodingAndCocktails directory by running the command `mkdir CodingAndCocktails`

    {% hint style='tip' %}
`mkdir` stands for make directory
    
Then you provide the name of the directory that you want to create
    {% endhint %}
    
4. If you want to move into that directory use the `cd` command to get there: `cd CodingAndCocktails`    

{% hint style='info' %}
Most command line terminals (including the ones we use) are not case sensitive - but a few are! For our purposes, a folder named CodingAndCocktails is the same as one named codingandcocktails.
