
If you installed Cmder, you already have Git! Give yourself a high-five! 

Now all you have to do is configure some Git settings.

In this section we will:
1. Set your name in Git
1. Set your email in Git


1. Open Cmder by searching for "cmder" in the task bar or by selecting the pin in your **Start** menu.

1. At the prompt set your user name by running the command `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` replacing the text `Your Name` with your own first and last name, keeping the quotation marks.

1. Next, set your user email address by running the command `git config --global user.email youremail@example.com` replacing `youremail@example.com` with your own actual email address.

1. Take a moment to verify your git version by typing `git --version` in Cmder. You must have git version 2.16.0 or higher for session work.
