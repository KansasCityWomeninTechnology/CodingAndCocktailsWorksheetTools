# Version Control
Git is version control software. It helps us keep track of different versions of our code and lets us collaborate with other developers on a project. We will use [**GitHub**](https://github.com), an essential cloud-based companion tool to Git. This is where your code repositories are stored.

## Create a Github account
If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip to the next section.

1. In your browser, [sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) by entering a username, email address, and password.
1. In Step 2: Choose your plan, select **Unlimited public repositories for free** and click **Continue**.
1. Fill out the survey or skip Step 3.

## Install Git
Click on the arrow (^) below to expand the section for your operating system.

<!--sec data-title="Windows" data-id="section0" data-show=true data-collapse=true ces-->

## Install GitKraken
GitKraken is a GUI for Git that will help visualize changes as we learn about version control. 

GitKraken is free for non-commercial use, but it will occasionally ask if you are using GitKraken for commercial use. Select that you are using it for non-commercial use.

1. Download GitKraken from [https://www.gitkraken.com](https://www.gitkraken.com).
1. Install GitKraken. It will ask you to create an account or connect to GitHub. Select the option to connect to GitHub and enter your GitHub credentials.
