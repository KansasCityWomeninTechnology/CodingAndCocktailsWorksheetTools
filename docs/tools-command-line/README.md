# Command Line Tools

The command prompt is what we use to enter specific commands for some of our tools, such as when we use Git for version control. While point-and-click programs work for daily use, when it comes to programming you will need to use the command line to take advantage of the most powerful tools your computer has to offer, so we teach you to get comfortable with it right from the beginning.
