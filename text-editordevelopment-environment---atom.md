Sublime Text 2

Sublime Text 2 is the Integrated Development Environment \(IDE\) we use. After downloading we will configure it with extra tools called _plugins_ that will make your coding life easier.

Note: Sublime can be downloaded for free but they do ask that you buy a license to use it if you like it. However, the tool doesn’t just stop working after the evaluation period so if you like it and decide to continue using it you should support the developers by buying a license when you are ready to make that commitment.

* Install Sublime Text 2 - [http://www.sublimetext.com/2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2). For Windows, download the 64-bit version. Follow the normal installation process.

* Follow the prompts as they appear and click **Finish** when prompted to complete the installation.


Configuring Sublime Text:

Next, to get the most out of Sublime, you’ll want to install some additional plugins. If you have ever downloaded and installed a custom font to use in your word processing program, installing plugins is similar. They are additional features that can be individually installed to enhance your experience.

* Install Package Control \([https://packagecontrol.io/installation](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)\). This will help install other plugins.

  * Go to **View menu--&gt;Console**. This splits your Sublime Screen into several regions.

  * At the package control web site above, click on the “Sublime Text 2” tab and copy the paragraph of code _as is_. Paste it into the input area of your console, as shown below, and press \_\*\*\_to install the package. The white area in the middle third of the page will tell you that it is downloading package control.

You will be prompted to restart Sublime Text for the changes to take effect. Go ahead and do that now. Now that the package control is installed, when you navigate to **Preferences--&gt;Package Control** \(or type cmd+shift+p \(Windows\) or cmd+shift+p \(Macs\)\)**,** you have more options available. Typing in the command executes the action:
