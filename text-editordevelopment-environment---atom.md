#Atom

Atom is the Integrated Development Environment \(IDE\) we use. After downloading we will configure it with extra tools called _plugins_ that will make your coding life easier.

1. Install Atom - [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)

2. Download the file then open it and follow the prompts as they appear. Click **Finish** when prompted to complete the installation.


####Configuring Atom:

Next, to get the most out of Atom, you’ll want to install some additional plugins. If you have ever downloaded and installed a custom font to use in your word processing program, installing plugins is similar. They are additional features that can be individually installed to enhance your experience.

####Suggested Plugins:
Go to the `Atom` menu and choose `Preferences`.  This will open the settings where you'll choose `Install` from the left side

  * **Emmet** – speed up your coding with auto completion in HTML and CSS code
  
    Search for `emmet` and click the `Install` button

  * atom-beautify

  * ColorPicker – insert/change/select colors

  * file-icon



* * Make it look pretty with themes

    * Soda 

    * Dracula 
    
    * Seti
    
    * Monokai




* To uninstall a package open the settings like we did above.  Choose `Packages` from the settings menu and search for the package you’d like to uninstall.  Click on the `Uninstall` button.
