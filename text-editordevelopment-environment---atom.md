# Text Editor: Atom

Atom is the Integrated Development Environment \(IDE\) we use. After downloading we will configure it with extra tools called _plugins_ that will make your coding life easier.

1. Install Atom - [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)

2. Download the file then open it and follow the prompts as they appear. Click **Finish** when prompted to complete the installation.

### Configuring Atom:

Next, to get the most out of Atom, you’ll want to install some additional plugins. If you have ever downloaded and installed a custom font to use in your word processing program, installing plugins is similar. They are additional features that can be individually installed to enhance your experience.

### Required Plugins:

For Mac, navigate to `Atom` menu and select `Preferences`.  In Windows, navigate to `File` menu and select `Settings`. This will open the settings where you'll choose `Install` from the left side

* **Emmet** – speed up your coding with auto completion in HTML and CSS code

  Search for `emmet` and click the `Install` button

### Suggested Plugins:

* **Atom Beautify** - beautify your code.  This means it will add indentations for you to make your code better organized and easier to read.

  Search for `atom-beautify` and click the `Install` button

* **Color Picker** – select colors from within your code

  Search for `color-picker` and click the `Install` button

* **File Icons** - display colorful icons in your projet folder display to quickly identify file types

  Search for `file-icons` and click the `Install` button

* Make it look pretty with **themes**. Click on the `Themes` button next to the search area to try searching for themes instead of packages.
