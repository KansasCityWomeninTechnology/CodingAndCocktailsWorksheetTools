#Atom

Atom is the Integrated Development Environment \(IDE\) we use. After downloading we will configure it with extra tools called _plugins_ that will make your coding life easier.

1. Install Atom - [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)

2. Follow the prompts as they appear and click **Finish** when prompted to complete the installation.


####Configuring Atom:

Next, to get the most out of Atom, you’ll want to install some additional plugins. If you have ever downloaded and installed a custom font to use in your word processing program, installing plugins is similar. They are additional features that can be individually installed to enhance your experience.

* Additional plugins:Press ctrl+shift+p \(Windows\) or cmd+shift+p \(Mac\) to open the Command Palette Search for “Package Control: Install Package” and press **enter** when you find it. Then package control will open a list of available packages/plugins for you to install.
