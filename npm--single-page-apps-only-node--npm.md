#Node & npm

Node is a JavaScript runtime - this means where JavaScript used to be confined to a web browser you can now run JavaScript on your computer.

npm is a package manager for JavaScript packages.  This allows you to manage and use code from other developers so you don't have to reinvent the wheel and can reuse handy bits of code for common functionality.

###Node
In Google Chrome go to [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Check that you have correctly installed Node by running the command `node --version` in your command line tool (Git Bash for windows or iTerm2 for macs)

###npm
npm is installed with Node.  Check that you have npm installed in your command line tool (Git Bash for windows or iTerm2 for macs) with the command `npm --version`
