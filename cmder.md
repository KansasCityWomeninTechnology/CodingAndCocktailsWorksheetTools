The default command line tool in windows is the "Command Prompt". You can find it by going to **Start**ü°í**Programs** and searching for ‚ÄúCommand Prompt‚Äù. You can also find it through Windows explorer. 

However, the windows command prompt does not offer much flexibility and functionality. Because of this, we will use Cmder. 

Cmder also includes another tool we use, Git, all packaged together. 

This section will help guide you through the following steps:
- [ ] Download Cmder and create a folder in your home directory
- [ ] Extract Cmder to the newly created folder
1. Install additional files required by Cmder
1. Verify installation by launching Cmder
1. Optional- Add Cmder to your **Start** menu 


### Download Cmder
1. Open the Cmder website by navigating to [https://www.cmder.net/](https://www.cmder.net/)
1. Scroll down to the Download section and click on "Download Full" to download Cmder. This might take a while.
1. While Cmder is downloading, let's get started on creating a folder by opening the **File Explorer**. You can do so by clicking on the yellow folder icon or searching for "File Explorer" in your task bar.
1. Navigate to your home directory by typing it in your file location bar. It is usually `C:\Users\[Your Login Name]\`.
