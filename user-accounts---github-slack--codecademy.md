# User Accounts: Slack, GitHub, Codecademy & CodePen

Coding & Cocktails supports your own efforts to learn to code. Therefore, in between sessions, you will want to continue to practice on your own. We refer to these sites often in the sessions as critical tools that we use to help learn to code. The accounts are free unless you choose to buy a premium subscription but that is not necessary for anything we do here.

* **Slack**: [kcwit.slack.com](http://kcwit.slack.com) - our 24x7 chat room.  The \#codingandcocktails channel will help you keep in touch with all of your Coding & Cocktails girlfriends. 

    However, an administrator has to invite you so if you did not receive an invitation, please email us at [codingandcocktails@kcwomenintech.org](mailto:codingandcocktails@kcwomenintech.org) and weâ€™ll take care of you.

    We also have non-development channels to share inspirational #ladybosses, #omnomnom for recipes, #diy to show off your latest project, #fitness and more! See the slack documentation to learn how to join more channels: [https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Browse-and-join-channels](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Browse-and-join-channels)
    

* **Github**: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) - this is the essential cloud-based companion tool to Git. This is where your code repositories will be stored.

* **Codecademy**: [https://www.codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com) - provides easy to follow, hands-on lessons on many of the topics covered in class.
