# Cmder

The default command line tool in windows is the "Command Prompt". You can find it by going to **Start**ü°í**Programs** and searching for ‚ÄúCommand Prompt‚Äù. You can also find it through Windows explorer. 

However, the windows command prompt does not offer much flexibility and functionality. Because of this, we will use Cmder. 

Cmder also includes another tool we use, Git, all packaged together. 

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

1. While Cmder is downloading, let's get started on creating a folder by opening the **File Explorer**. You can do so by clicking on the yellow folder icon or searching for "File Explorer" in your task bar.

1. Navigate to your home directory by typing it in your file location bar. It is usually `C:\Users\[Your Login Name]\`.

## Verify installation {#verify}
1. Close the Cmder dialog by typing "exit" and pressing **Enter** or by clicking on the X in the upper right corner.

Always run Cmder as administrator. Doing so will ensure Cmder has file access it needs for session worksheets.

#### Cmder benefits

Cmder helps identify certain things with different colors. Here are some of the colors you might run across.

* Your prompt will look like a lambda \(**Œª**\).

* The name of the directory \(aka folder\) you‚Äôre currently in will be displayed in olive-green 

* If you‚Äôre in a git repository your branch name will be displayed right after the name of the directory you're in.

* If you have uncommitted version control changes made in the repository that you‚Äôre in, the branch name will turn red.
